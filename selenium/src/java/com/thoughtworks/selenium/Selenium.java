<h3><a name="locators"></a>Element Locators</h3><p>
Element Locators tell Selenium which HTML element a command refers to.
The format of a locator is:</p><blockquote><em>locatorType</em><strong>=</strong><em>argument</em></blockquote><p>
We support the following strategies for locating elements:
</p><ul><li><strong>identifier</strong>=<em>id</em>: 
Select the element with the specified @id attribute. If no match is
found, select the first element whose @name attribute is <em>id</em>.
(This is normally the default; see below.)</li><li><strong>id</strong>=<em>id</em>:
Select the element with the specified @id attribute.</li><li><strong>name</strong>=<em>name</em>:
Select the first element with the specified @name attribute.
<ul class="first last simple"><li>username</li><li>name=username</li></ul><p>The name may optionally be followed by one or more <em>element-filters</em>, separated from the name by whitespace.  If the <em>filterType</em> is not specified, <strong>value</strong> is assumed.</p><ul class="first last simple"><li>name=flavour value=chocolate</li></ul></li><li><strong>dom</strong>=<em>javascriptExpression</em>: 

Find an element by evaluating the specified string.  This allows you to traverse the HTML Document Object
Model using JavaScript.  Note that you must not return a value in this string; simply make it the last expression in the block.
<ul class="first last simple"><li>dom=document.forms['myForm'].myDropdown</li><li>dom=document.images[56]</li><li>dom=function foo() { return document.links[1]; }; foo();</li></ul></li><li><strong>xpath</strong>=<em>xpathExpression</em>: 
Locate an element using an XPath expression.
<ul class="first last simple"><li>xpath=//img[@alt='The image alt text']</li><li>xpath=//table[@id='table1']//tr[4]/td[2]</li><li>xpath=//a[contains(@href,'#id1')]</li><li>xpath=//a[contains(@href,'#id1')]/@class</li><li>xpath=(//table[@class='stylee'])//th[text()='theHeaderText']/../td</li><li>xpath=//input[@name='name2' and @value='yes']</li><li>xpath=//*[text()="right"]</li></ul></li><li><strong>link</strong>=<em>textPattern</em>:
Select the link (anchor) element which contains text matching the
specified <em>pattern</em>.
<ul class="first last simple"><li>link=The link text</li></ul></li><li><strong>css</strong>=<em>cssSelectorSyntax</em>:
Select the element using css selectors. Please refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html">CSS2 selectors</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/">CSS3 selectors</a> for more information. You can also check the TestCssLocators test in the selenium test suite for an example of usage, which is included in the downloaded selenium core package.
<ul class="first last simple"><li>css=a[href="#id3"]</li><li>css=span#firstChild + span</li></ul><p>Currently the css selector locator supports all css1, css2 and css3 selectors except namespace in css3, some pseudo classes(:nth-of-type, :nth-last-of-type, :first-of-type, :last-of-type, :only-of-type, :visited, :hover, :active, :focus, :indeterminate) and pseudo elements(::first-line, ::first-letter, ::selection, ::before, ::after). </p></li></ul><p>
Without an explicit locator prefix, Selenium uses the following default
strategies:
</p><ul class="simple"><li><strong>dom</strong>, for locators starting with "document."</li><li><strong>xpath</strong>, for locators starting with "//"</li><li><strong>identifier</strong>, otherwise</li></ul><h3><a name="element-filters">Element Filters</a></h3><blockquote><p>Element filters can be used with a locator to refine a list of candidate elements.  They are currently used only in the 'name' element-locator.</p><p>Filters look much like locators, ie.</p><blockquote><em>filterType</em><strong>=</strong><em>argument</em></blockquote><p>Supported element-filters are:</p><p><strong>value=</strong><em>valuePattern</em></p><blockquote>
Matches elements based on their values.  This is particularly useful for refining a list of similarly-named toggle-buttons.</blockquote><p><strong>index=</strong><em>index</em></p><blockquote>
Selects a single element based on its position in the list (offset from zero).</blockquote></blockquote><h3><a name="patterns"></a>String-match Patterns</h3><p>
Various Pattern syntaxes are available for matching string values:
</p><ul><li><strong>glob:</strong><em>pattern</em>:
Match a string against a "glob" (aka "wildmat") pattern. "Glob" is a
kind of limited regular-expression syntax typically used in command-line
shells. In a glob pattern, "*" represents any sequence of characters, and "?"
represents any single character. Glob patterns match against the entire
string.</li><li><strong>regexp:</strong><em>regexp</em>:
Match a string using a regular-expression. The full power of JavaScript
regular-expressions is available.</li><li><strong>regexpi:</strong><em>regexpi</em>:
Match a string using a case-insensitive regular-expression.</li><li><strong>exact:</strong><em>string</em>:

Match a string exactly, verbatim, without any of that fancy wildcard
stuff.</li></ul><p>
If no pattern prefix is specified, Selenium assumes that it's a "glob"
pattern.
