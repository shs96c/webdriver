/**
 * The main interface to use for testing, which represents an idealised web
 * browser. The methods in this class fall into three categories:
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Control of the browser itself</li>
 * <li>Selection of {@link WebElement}s</li>
 * <li>Debugging aids</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Key methods are {@link WebDriver#get(String)}, which is used to load a new
 * web page, and the various methods similar to
 * {@link WebDriver#selectElement(String)}, which is used to find
 * {@link WebElement}s.
 * <p/>
 * Currently, you will need to instantiate implementations of this class
 * directly. It is hoped that you write your tests against this interface so
 * that you may "swap in" a more fully featured browser when there is a
 * requirement for one. Given this approach to testing, it is best to start
 * writing your tests using the {@link com.thoughtworks.webdriver.htmlunit.HtmlUnitDriver} implementation.
 * <p/>
 * Note that all methods that use XPath to locate elements will throw a
 * {@link RuntimeException} should there be an error thrown by the underlying
 * XPath engine.
 *
